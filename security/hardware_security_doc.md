# Diu Hardware Security

## Overview

This README.md file covers the security threats, measures, threat model, and mitigation strategies for the Diu Hardware project, a Rust program that initializes a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server on an ESP32 microcontroller. It is essential to consider these security aspects when designing and implementing the project, especially when sensitive or confidential data is involved.

## Security Issues

1. **Lack of encryption**: The non_secure_characteristic is created without encryption, allowing data to be intercepted and read by anyone listening to BLE traffic.
2. **Weak authentication**: A simple six-digit number (123456) is used as a passkey for authentication, which can be easily guessed by an attacker.
3. **Potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**: The on_connect function is used to start advertising when a client connects to the server, which may be vulnerable to flooding with connection requests.
4. **Injection attacks**: The on_write function handles incoming data without proper sanitization, potentially leading to injection attacks.
5. **Malicious firmware updates**: The code does not implement measures to prevent malicious firmware updates, which can compromise the device.

## Security Measures

1. **Encryption**: Add encryption to the non_secure_characteristic using NimbleProperties::READ_ENC and NimbleProperties::READ_AUTHEN flags to ensure data is encrypted and accessible only by authorized clients.
2. **Stronger authentication**: Implement a stronger passkey or advanced authentication mechanisms, such as pairing with a trusted device or using public key cryptography.
3. **DoS protection**: Implement rate limiting or other mechanisms to limit the number of connection requests processed at a time, and employ network-level protections like firewalls or intrusion detection systems.
4. **Input validation**: Validate and sanitize incoming data to prevent injection attacks, including checking data length and format, and using input validation and output encoding techniques.
5. **Firmware protection**: Implement secure boot and firmware verification mechanisms, using digital signatures to verify firmware updates and secure storage mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Threat Model

1. **Adversary**: Potential attackers interested in compromising the system or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted over the Bluetooth connection.
2. **Attack surface**: Bluetooth connection, firmware update process, and device storage.
3. **Attack vectors**: Bluetooth connection, firmware updates, and device storage.
4. **Risks**: Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
5. **Mitigations**: Use strong authentication and encryption mechanisms, validate and sanitize incoming data, implement encryption for the Bluetooth connection and sensitive data, prevent DoS attacks, and secure firmware updates.
6. **Threat actors**: Hackers, competitors, and insiders.
7. **Threats**: Eavesdropping, injection attacks, DoS attacks, and unauthorized access.
8. **Mitigations**: Conduct regular security assessments, implement multi-factor authentication and encryption, use secure boot and firmware verification, protect sensitive data, detect and respond to potential threats, and update software and firmware.
9. **Potential attacks**: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, injection attack, DoS attack, and unauthorized access.
10. **Risk assessment**: Assess the potential impact on the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
11. **Mitigation strategies**: Implement strong authentication, encryption, input validation, DoS prevention, firmware protection, and secure storage.
12. **Security controls**: Access controls, data encryption, intrusion detection and prevention, regular security updates, penetration testing, and security training.
13. **Security policies**: Password policies, data retention policies, incident response policies, and acceptable use policies.
14. **Continuous monitoring**: Monitor the system for potential threats, review security controls and policies, conduct security assessments, and penetration testing regularly, and ensure prompt responses to detected threats.

## Conclusion

By addressing the security issues and implementing the recommended security measures, the Diu Hardware can be made more secure against potential threats. It is essential to monitor the system continuously and adapt security measures as needed to protect against evolving threats and vulnerabilities.
